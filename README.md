Tool to explore the potential for immortal time bias


## Installation & use ##


If you have the `devtools` package installed, you can install `IMMORTOOL` with the following commend from R:

```R
devtools::install_github('petedodd/IMMORTOOL',dependencies=TRUE)
```

The library can then be loaded ahead of use. The shiny app can be started as follows:
```R
library(IMMORTOOL)
run_app()
```

Depending on your system, this may open the app in a system web browser. You may need to stop the app from R by typing Cntrl-C or other exiting the function.

Apart from the shiny app, a number of utility functions are provided that can be used without the GUI. These include:
